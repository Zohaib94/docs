# Cosmic JS REST API

The Cosmic JS REST API and available clients help you manage content for your websites and applications. We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your private keys or credentials in any public website's client-side code). JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

The API is fully CRUD capable, allowing you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete requests to your Cosmic JS Buckets. 

## Getting Started

Go to [https://cosmicjs.com/signup](https://cosmicjs.com/signup) to create an account and get familiar with the Cosmic JS Dashboard.

## API Endpoint
You can make direct calls the REST API from the following base URL.
```
https://api.cosmicjs.com
```

## Node.js Installation

```bash
npm i cosmicjs
```
