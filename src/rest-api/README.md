# Cosmic JS REST API

The Cosmic JS REST API helps you easily manage data and files for websites and applications. We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your private keys or credentials in any public website's client-side code). JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

Some code samples are runnable using [Runkit](https://runkit.com/home).
